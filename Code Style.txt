White-space and Braces:
    1. Since Qt uses spaces by default so shall we
    2. In the case of optional braces ( a one line if/else ) please use a brace for readability
    
Naming Convention:
    1. We will be using camelCase as the convention for functions, variables, and classes. (eg getStuff )
    2. Classes first letter should be capitalized. (eg MainWindow)
    
Documentation:
    1. To make this easy on writing the doxygen in the end please include documentation on any new function.
    
    /** 
      * @param something a boolean setting something
      * @return stuff that is extra useful
      * 
      * This method does unbelievably useful things.  
      * And returns exceptionally useful results.
      * Use it everyday with good health.
      */
    int getStuff( bool something ){
        return stuff
    }
