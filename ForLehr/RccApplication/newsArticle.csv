Throw in a short tempered bad guy, a cookie with an attitude and over a dozen other fairy tale misfits, and you’ve got the kind of mess that calls for a real hero.

  Riverside City College’s Career and Technical Education (CTE) department will hold an event – Non-traditional Employment for Women (NEW) - on October 17 at 9 am, encouraging young women to consider careers in CTE fields. RCC expects 250 local high school students from five local high schools to attend the NEW career-exploration event.

  According to a national study in March 2013 conducted by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research and Wider Opportunities for Women under the auspices of the National Coalition of Women and Girls in Education and the National Coalition on Women, Jobs and Job Training, women are sorely underrepresented in CTE fields. Fewer than one in six students nationally are studying in fields such as architecture and construction-related CTE programs, and fewer than one in 10 students in transportation, distribution and logistics are women. Conversely, women comprise 80 percent of students enrolled in human services CTE programs, which lead to lower-paying positions.

 <div style='text-align:justify'>
  <br>
 </div> 
 <div style='text-align:justify'>
  “This event will expose young women to occupations that normally they wouldn’t consider or have possibly never heard of,” said Patricia Avila, the College’s director of CTE programs. “Many of these programs are underrepresented by women traditionally, so our goal is to dispel the myth that women are not suited for these career paths. We hope this event will generate interest among the girls.”

  <p class='ms-rteThemeFontFace-2 ms-rteFontSize-3'><span>RCC will receive over $1.1 million over the next three years; meanwhile, NC will get $1.4 million.</span></p>

It will also allow the hiring of adjunct faculty to teach new curriculum in quality assurance, operations and production management and quality systems.
